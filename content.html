    <h1>Harry Potter's Life<h1>  

        
   <p>  Harry Potter is an average 11 year old boy who has lived with the Dursley family
    ever since his parents died in a car crash.  The family has always mistreats him because he persons were
    wizards. On his 11th birthday a giant man named Rubeus Hagrid hands him a letter telling him that he has been 
    accepted as a student at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry learns that his parents
    were wizards and were killed by an evil wizard Voldemort, a truth that was hidden from him all these years
    from his Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon.He embarks for his new life as a student, gathering two good friends
    Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger  along the way.They soon learn that something very valuable is hidden
    somewhere inside the school and Voldemort is very anxious to lay his hands on it. 
    
      Another year goes by and Harry is forced to spend his summer holidays with his muggle relatives, Harry Potter 
    gets a real shock when he gets a surprise visitor: Dobby the house-elf, who warns Harry Potter against returning to Hogwarts, 
    for terrible things are going to happen. Harry decides to ignore 
    Dobby's warning and continues with his pre-arranged schedule. 
    But at Hogwarts, strange and terrible things are happening: Harry is suddenly hearing mysterious voices
    from inside the walls, muggle-born students are being attacked, and a message scrawled on the wall in blood puts
    everyone on his/her guard - "The Chamber Of Secrets Has Been Opened. Enemies Of The Heir, Beware" .
    
      Harry Potter's  third year at Hogwarts starts off badly when he learns about killer Sirius Black 
    has escaped from Azkaban prison and is bent on murdering the teenage wizard. While Hermione's 
    cat torments Ron's sickly rat, causing a rift among the trio, a swarm of nasty Dementors is sent to protect
    the school from Black. A mysterious new teacher named Mr.Lupin helps Harry learn to defend himself, 
    but what is his secret tie to Sirius Black?
    
      Harry's fourth year at Hogwarts is about to start and he is enjoying the summer vacation with his friends.
    They get the tickets to The Quidditch World Cup Final but after the match is over, people dressed like Lord Voldemort's 'Death Eaters' 
    set a fire to all the visitors' tents, coupled with the appearance of Voldemort's symbol, the 'Dark Mark' in the sky, which causes
    a frenzy across the magical community. That same year, Hogwarts is hosting 'The Triwizard Tournament', a magical tournament between
    three well-known schools of magic : Hogwarts, Beauxbatons and Durmstrang. The contestants have to be above the age of 17, and are 
    chosen by a magical object called Goblet of Fire. However, the Goblet spews out four names instead of the usual three, Harry happens to
    be the 4th contestant and his isn't 17 yet.  Since the magic cannot be reversed, Harry is forced to go 
    with it and brave three exceedingly difficult tasks.
    
      Now in his fifth year at Hogwarts, Harry learns that many in the wizarding community do not know
    the truth of his encounter with Lord Voldemort. Cornelius Fudge, minister of Magic, appoints his toady, Dolores Umbridge,
    as Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, for he fears that Professor Dumbledore will take his job. But her teaching is
    deficient and her methods, cruel, so Harry prepares a group of students to defend the school against a rising tide of evil.
    
       When Harry enters his sixth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Harry Potter has come under the imperssion that 
    Draco Malfoy has became a Death Eater.  Like all the other years, Professor Snape contuines to make Harry's Life miserable. 
    Also during Professsor Slughorn's potions class, Harry discovers a old potions book written by the mysterious 'Half - Blood Prince'.
    This book has spells and potions that are rewritten. Harry actually wins the Felix Felicis the Pro.Slughorn has to offer. Also Harry 
    is put on a mission by Dumbledore to find out the info that Tom Riddle asked Slughorn. The info was horcruxes. This movie is all when 
    Dumbledore dies.
    
      In the last book, Harry starts looking for the horcruxes that Volodemort has created. He has to destroy Tom Riddles diary, Tom Riddle's 
    mom's ring, slytherin locket,ravenclaw diadem, the cup in Belatrix's volt, Nagini, and Harry Potter (HIMSElf). When Harry realizes that
    one of the hocruxes is at Hogwarts he goes to Hogsmade to go throught th secret passage to Hogwarts. But at Hogwarts Professor Snape 
    becomes headmaster and Hogwarts is filled with darkness. A important part of the story is that Dobby dies at Malfoy Manor, and alot 
    of wizards/witches dies at the battle of Hogwarts. In the end, Harry defeat Volodemort and everyone is happy (except for deatheaters).
